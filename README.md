# ATS_AI_Testing
This contains the LLM prompts I created to align a resume with ATS services, and to check for AI use.

I created these prompts to help job seekers combat recent AI deployment to application tracking services. In addition, I created a different prompt that will review a text block and rank it, on a scale of 1-5, regarding if it was created by AI. This prompt also offers suggestions to lower the score. 

The ATS review works best with GPT and the AI review works best with Gemini
